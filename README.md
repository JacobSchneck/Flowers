# Final-Project-jschnec1
## Summary 
Hello! Spring is in the air! Can't you smell it? No, well that stinks. On a totally unrelated note, this is a program that plants flowers. Three flowers to be exact: BasicFlower, SunFlower, and ElongatedFlower. These flowers aren't like those lazy no good real flowers outside. These flowers spin. So forget about nature and spring and lets plant some flowers! 

## Contributers
All code is authored by Jacob Schneck or Lisa Dion. (The shapes and parts of graphics.cpp/graphics.h are of the brain trust of Lisa Dion)

## How to Run
This was written on WSL (windows subsytem for linux) as such it would likely function best on other linux distrubitions. To run the program, type in terminal

```console
    make 
```

You will be prompted for the randomized color scheme and the standard scheme at the beginning of the program. From there, a graphics window will open. Left click to plant a flower, right click to remove a flower. 's' key spins the flowers, 'r' toggles the color scheme from random to standard. \
 \
To run tests

```console
    make tests 
```

This program uses openGL and GLUT libraries for c++, so best to have those installed on your computer.

## Concepts
Module Two: Class relationships (has-a/is-a), polymorphism, testing, i/o stream with input validation \
Module Four: Graphics, Keyboard and Mouse input
